# Kubernetes operator demo

### Installation prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster (local or remote)
- Kubebuilder v3 installed (version 3.0.0 or higher)
- Docker installed and configured
- Go programming language installed (version 1.16 or higher)

## Initialise

1. Create a new directory for your operator:
```shell
$ mkdir nginx-operator-demo
$ cd nginx-operator-demo
```

2. Initialize the Kubebuilder project:
```shell
$ export GO111MODULE=on
$ export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
$ kubebuilder init --domain kube-operator.local
```

3. Create the custom API:
```shell
$ kubebuilder create api --group apps --version v1 --image=nginx:latest --kind App --plugins=deploy-image.go.kubebuilder.io/alpha
```

4. Customise files in `api/v1/custom_types.go`


5. Customise controller in `internal/controller/custom_controller.go`


6. Install the CRDs in the cluster.
```shell
make install
```
or
```shell
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/apps.kubeoperator.local_apps.yaml
```

7. Configure your application at `config/samples/custom_v1_app.yaml`


8. Start our custom controller
```shell
make run
```

9. Once the controller starting running we have to create the website workload using the yaml that we wrote.
```shell
kubectl create -f config/samples/config/samples/custom_v1_app.yaml
```

10. Verify
```shell
kubectl get app -n <namespace>
kubectl get deployments -n <namespace>
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
kubectl get hpa -n <namespace>
```

## Run


## Original getting started guide

### Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

#### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-operator-demo:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-operator-demo:tag
```

#### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

#### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
